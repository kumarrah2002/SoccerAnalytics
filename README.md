With over 1.1 billion people watching the 2018 World Cup, there is no doubt that soccer is the most popular sport on the planetâ€”specifically at the FIFA World Cup. This project aims to derive features that are significant in predicting soccer outcomes and whether there is a relationship between betting odds placed by bookkeepers and the result of the match. This is important because betting is extremely prevalent in the biggest competition in the sport. Hence, the results from this project can better advise those placing bets on such tournaments and whether it is worthwhile. Ultimately, this project found that with the best model, the odds that bookkeepers make along with other features are accurate 75% of the time in predicting the outcome of World Cup matches. This implies that while there is a relatively high accuracy rate for this particular model, there is an average correlation between the betting feature and the full-time result.
